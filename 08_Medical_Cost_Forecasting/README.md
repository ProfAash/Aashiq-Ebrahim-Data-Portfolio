# Medical Cost Forecasting: Linear Regression Analysis
**Focus:** Predictive Modeling, Correlation Analysis, and Risk Assessment

## Project Overview
This project utilizes a healthcare dataset to predict individual medical costs billed by health insurance. By applying Linear Regression, I identified the key drivers of insurance charges, providing actionable insights into how demographic and lifestyle factors influence financial risk.

## Technical Workflow
* **Exploratory Analysis:** Visualized the relationships between `age`, `bmi`, and `charges` using scatter plots to identify linear trends.
* **Model Building:** Utilized `Scikit-Learn` to train a Linear Regression model, splitting the data into training and testing sets to ensure predictive accuracy.
* **Interpretation:** Analyzed the model's intercept and coefficients to quantify the impact of each feature on the final cost.

## Strategic Insights
* **Primary Drivers:** The analysis confirms that age and lifestyle choices (such as smoking) are the most significant predictors of medical expenses.
* **Business Application:** This model serves as a foundational tool for "Risk-Based Pricing," allowing firms to forecast future liabilities based on applicant profiles.
