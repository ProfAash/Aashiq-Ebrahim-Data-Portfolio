Forbes Top-Ten Highest-Paid Athletes (1990-2020)

Project Type: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Data Visualization
Tools Used: Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib)

**Executive Summary**
  This project analyzes 30 years of sports earnings data to identify shifts in global sports wealth. I performed a full data lifecycle process: from cleaning "dirty" ranking data to visualizing the commercial explosion of modern sports.

**Key Insights**

The Earnings Explosion:
  Athlete earnings remained relatively stable in the 1990s but saw exponential growth post-2000, driven by massive broadcasting rights and global endorsements.

Sport Dominance Shift:
  Identified a transition from individual-heavy sports (Boxing, Golf) in the 90s to team-based global icons (Soccer, Basketball) in the 2010s.

Rank vs. Revenue: 
  Used a correlation heatmap to prove that lower numerical rank (#1) strongly correlates with higher income, though "Brand Power" outliers in Golf and Tennis often break this trend.

**Technical Skills Showcased**

Data Cleaning:
  Handled missing values in 'Previous Year Ranked' and standardized currency formats.

Feature Engineering:
  Converted data types for chronological analysis.

Statistical Visualization:
  Created Heatmaps, Line Plots, and Bar Charts to communicate complex trends to stakeholders.
