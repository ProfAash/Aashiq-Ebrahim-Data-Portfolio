# Aashiq-Ebrahim-Data-Portfolio
Welcome to my technical portfolio. This repository is a comprehensive showcase of my ability to navigate the full data science lifecycle—from raw data ingestion and cleaning to advanced statistical modeling and deep learning.

Technical Ecosystem:
- I leverage a modern stack to extract meaning from noise:

- Languages: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

- Statistics: PCA, Linear/Logistic Regression, Hypothesis Evaluation

- Machine Learning: K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, Decision Trees

- Deep Learning: Neural Network Architecture (Sigmoid, Matrix Math)

Project Navigation:

I have categorized my work into four primary domains of expertise:

1. Advanced Statistical Analysis & Dimensionality Reduction:

  - These projects demonstrate my ability to simplify complex, high-dimensional data without losing predictive power.

  - US Arrests: Multivariate PCA: Used PCA to explain 87% of variance in crime data.

  - Iris 3D PCA Projection: Visualizing 4-dimensional data in 3D space.

2. Supervised Learning & Predictive Modeling:

  Focusing on forecasting numerical values and classifying outcomes.

  Titanic Survival Prediction: Decision Tree Classifier with optimized hyperparameter tuning.

  Medical Cost Forecasting: Multiple Linear Regression to predict insurance premiums.

  Iris Species Classification: Logistic Regression achieving 100% test accuracy.

3. Unsupervised Learning & Clustering:

  Identifying hidden patterns and segmenting populations without pre-existing labels.

  Iris Taxonomy Analysis: Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering using Dendrograms.

4. Foundations of AI & Deep Learning:

  Going "under the hood" to understand the mathematical mechanics of AI.

  Neural Network Foundations: Building a multi-layer perceptron from scratch to solve XOR logic gates.

Featured Insight: The "Honest Analyst" Approach

  In my Diabetes Progression Analysis. Instead presenting a flawed model, I documented the limitations of a linear approach for this clinical data. This project highlights my commitment to data integrity and my ability to recommend the right tool for the job.
