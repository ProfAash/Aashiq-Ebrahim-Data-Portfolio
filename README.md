About Me
I am a data-driven Analyst with a focus on Predictive Modeling and Advanced Statistical Analysis. I recently completed a rigorous Data Science program with a 97% aggregate, where I developed a portfolio spanning the entire data lifecycle.

My approach combines technical precision—ranging from Neural Networks and PCA to Multiclass Classification—with a critical mindset for model evaluation. I don't just build models; I rigorously test them for business and clinical reliability. My goal is to transform complex, multi-dimensional data into clear, actionable insights that drive strategic decision-making.
